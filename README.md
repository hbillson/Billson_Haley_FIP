# Haley B Design & Development Portfolio

This is a web-based portfolio that I built using the skills I've developed over my time in the Interactive Media Design program at Fanshawe College. The website features some of my favourite examples of my design work so far. 

## Requirements 

You'll need Gitbash/Bash/a terminal window and a good browser (this was tested in Chrome).

## Installation

1. Clone the GitHub repository from the repository's webpage into the desired location on your computer.

```bash
git clone [link]
```
2. Import the database into whatever you use to access SQL databases. 
3. Adjust the code to direct fetch functions to the right location in order to access the database.
